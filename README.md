Performed aggregations, filtering, and group-based analysis

Answered scenario-based analytical and SQL-style questions

Followed industry-standard data wrangling and analysis practices

🛠 Tools & Technologies:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

This project demonstrates my ability to handle structured data, apply analytical thinking, and solve practical data problems relevant to Generative AI and data-driven system
